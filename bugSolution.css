The corrected CSS code demonstrates the proper use of `calc()` with no spaces around operators:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(100px + 20px);
  height: calc(50vh - 10px);
}
```
This will correctly calculate the width as 120px and the height as 50vh minus 10px.  Make sure to always adhere to the correct syntax to avoid unexpected results.
